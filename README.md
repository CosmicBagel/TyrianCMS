TyrianCMS
=========

A CMS for multi-game guilds built on rails.<br />
Why? To bring together a community of gamers across multiple games, and prevent segregation of the community caused
by player's divided interest in different games.

Core features:

<ol>
  <li>Login (content can be set to allow public viewing scope and community only viewing scope)</li>
  <li>Blogs (multimedia, drop your vlog in here too)</li>
  <li>Game Pages (team rosters, ranks, tutorials / tranining content, and a feature light knowledge base wiki)</li>
  <li>Calendar (organize events with your fellow community members)</li>
</ol>

------------------------------------------------

As this project is brand new, you can expect a total of NONE of these features to be functional.
We're two developers one with a PHP background, the other with an ASP .Net background. For us this is primarily
a learning excersize, but our hopes are that this will become a functional cms that others will be able to use.

Our development plan is basically to build up the login system, then the blogs, then the game pages, then the
calendar last. Once these core features are functional and tested to our tastes we'll begin fleshing out the CMS
feature by feature. Development will be done using SQLite, but an actual deployment of the CMS would be expected
to run on MySQL, at this time NoSQL databases do not interest us.
